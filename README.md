Muddy – AI Telegram Chatbot

Muddy is an intelligent Telegram chatbot built using the Telegram Bot API and Google Gemini (Generative AI).
It can understand user queries, respond naturally, and maintain conversation flow — while also detecting nonsense or gibberish messages and replying appropriately.

This bot is designed to feel more personal and friendly, instead of replying like a generic AI model.
